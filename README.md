This package provides a [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) implementation of
the ROC (Taiwan) Uniform Identification Number (中華民國統一證號) format.

This format is used by both National Identification Cards (國民身分證) and
Alien Resident Certificates (居留證). Each identification number consists of a
single uppercase letter followed by nine decimal digits, with the final digit
serving as a checksum, calculated according to a standard algorithm.

Example: `A123456789`

This package offers functions for validating, decoding, and encoding these
numbers.
